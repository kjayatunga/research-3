\section{Selection of the cross section}

The cross section selection process for this study was based to three key criteria 

\begin{itemize}
	\item The cross section should have a bluff front face with sharp upstream corners for the flow to separate at the leading edges;
	
	\item As the proximity of shear layers to the body plays a vital role in creating \cy\ \citep{Parkinson1989}, the cross section should have a basic level of streamlining.
	
	\item The cross section should consist of a geometric profile in the afterbody, to inhibit or delay the shear layer reattachment.   
\end{itemize}


The square cross section which has been widely used in galloping studies satisfies the first two selection criteria. Thus, a modification to the square cross section was done in order to meet the third criterion. Thus, in order to inhibit the shear layer reattachment, the top and bottom sides of the trailing edges of the square were tapered off and a hybrid cross section of a rectangle and a triangle (illustrated in figure \ref{fig:hybrid_section}), i.e, a pentagon was produced.

The inhibition of the shear layer can be varied systematically by varying one parameter, \ratio; which was an advantage of this cross section. The ratio $\ratio$ was varied from 1 to zero in increments of 0.25 where 1 is the square cross section and 0 is an isosceles triangle. 


\section{Static body results}


\input{./chapter-cross-sections/figures/coefficient-table.tex}

Stationary time averaged $C_y$ results were obtained for cross sections where $\ratio=$ $1$, $0.75$ ,$0.5$, $0.25$ and $0$ using DNS at $\reynoldsnumber=200$. Table \ref{table:cy-coefficients-hybrid} shows the coefficients of the $7^{th}$ order curve fitting for each cross section. To achieve a better fit, piecewise interpolation using multiple $7th$ order polynomials were incorporated for a single cross section, giving more importance to accurately fitting the positive portion of the $C_{y}$ curve; as the power transfer from the fluid to the body only occurs in this region.

\input{./chapter-cross-sections/figures/lift_curves.tex} 

The $C_y$ vs. $\theta$ curves in figure \ref{fig:lift_curves-hybrid} show the resultant of the piecewise curve-fits obtained for each cross section. A shift of the peak value of \cy\ to the right can be observed as the \ratio decreases therefore, the peak \cy\ occurs at higher induced angles. The overall trends of this behaviour agrees with trends of \citet{Luo1994} where the peak \cy\ value was shifted to higher induced angles when reattachment was delayed on a trapezoidal body. The peak value of \cy\ occurs at high induced velocities as \ratio\ is decreased because $\theta$ is proportional to the transverse velocity of the body via $\tan{\theta}=\frac{\dot{y}}{U}$. Thus, these bodies with a short straight section, or small \ratio, satisfy one of the three conditions required to optimize the power transfer. 

A negative region could be observed on the \cy vs. $\theta$ curves  where $\ratio\leq0.25$. In this region \cy\ decreases as $\theta$ is increased and the increases after reaching a minimum, non-zero value of $\theta$. The presence of this region indicates an unfavourable power transfer, i.e. power transferred from body to the fluid as the direction of the force and velocity vectors are out of phase. This implies that at low induced angles (when the $\dot{y}$ is low), power transfer is from the body to the fluid and as the transverse velocity increases power transfers from fluid to the body. Thus, it means that the direction of power transfer can be different at different points in a particular oscillation cycle, which will be further discussed in section \hilight{Section}. 



 \section{QSS Mean power output}
 \label{sec:mean power}
 
  
 \input{./chapter-cross-sections/figures/power_curves.tex}
 
Predictions of the mean power output of these different cross sections were obtained using the QSS model using the curve fits presented in figure \ref{fig:lift_curves-hybrid} as inputs. Figure \ref{fig:power_curves} shows the mean power vs. \massdamp\ for different cross sections namely $\ratio=1,0.75,0.5,0.25$ and $0$. The cross sections are divided into two classes; high ($\ratio > 0.25$) and low ($\ratio \leq 0.25$). As \massdamp\ increases the mean power increases, peaks and reduces. For high \ratio, the overall shape of the curves is similar, however as \ratio\ is decreased, the amount of power increases. For low \ratio, the overall curve shape is markedly different; power first increases with \massdamp, then peaks, and then drops dramatically. The power extracted also appears to decrease with a decrease in \ratio. Furthermore, negative regions of the \cy\ vs. $\theta$ curves in figure \ref{fig:lift_curves-hybrid} appear in the low \ratio\ cases. The change in the trend of power, and the appearance of a negative region in the \cy, for the low \ratio\ cases clearly indicates that there is a distinct change in the flow structure for these cases which is discussed in section \label{sec:negative-region}.
