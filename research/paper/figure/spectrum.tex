  \caption{Velocity signal (right) and the corresponding power spectrum (left) of the DNS data at 3 different \massstiff \ at $\massdamp=0.8$. (a) and (b) $\massstiff=10$, (c) and (d) $\massstiff=60$, (e) and (f) $\massstiff=250$, (g) and (h) $\massstiff=1000$. \ustar \ is kept at 40 therefore the mass ratio increases as \ \massstiff \ increases. It is evident that the influence of vortex shedding reduces as the inertia of the system increases.}
