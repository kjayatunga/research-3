\section{Introduction} 
The search for alternate energy sources which could be stamped under the "green" label has become important area of research in the modern word.Solar, wind power and tidal waves are some of the examples of these sources.  Recently,a new branch of research is being developing to extract energy from flow induced vibrations\cite{Bernitsas2008a-concept}. It has been hypothesized that this technique may work efficiently in areas where regular turbines would not be working efficiently. 

With regards to a slender body two common types of flow induced vibrations could   be found, namely Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) and aeroelastic galloping.Some significant research has been carried out by Bernitsas and his research on extracting useful energy from VIV.Some of their significant work includes investigating the influence  of physical parameters such as mass ratio (ratio of the mass of the cylinder and the displaced fluid), Reynolds number, mechanical properties (attach references)and location (effect of the bottom boundary) (reference).It could be seen from published literature (at the point in time of writing this article) that the possibility of extracting energy using aeroelastic galloping has not been thoroughly investigated where only some theoretical work was carried out by Barrero-Gil (Cite). Form the knowledge obtained by literature, utilizing galloping may be a more viable method to harness energy from flow induced vibrations as it is not bounded by a "lock-in" range of reduced velocities.Therefore it is "wise" to investigate further the possibility of harnessing energy from flow induced vibrations using aeroelastic galloping.

Real life energy harvesting systems consists of high damping because of the energy generator (e.g electrical generator).Therefore it is crucial to investigate on the behaviour of aeroleastic galloping scenarios at high damping ratios in order to optimise the system to obtain a acceptable power output.Hence the focus of this paper is concentrated on investigating the mechanical power output of high-damped galloping systems in laminar flow.
