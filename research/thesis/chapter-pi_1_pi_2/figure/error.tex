    \caption{The percentage error between the maximum power obtained using DNS data and predicted by QSS model as a function of  \massstiff. The QSS model prediction is worst for low values of  \massstiff. The dash curve (\protect\dashedrule) follows the power law fit of the percentage error which is $\% error=138.697\massstiff^{-0.6}$.}
