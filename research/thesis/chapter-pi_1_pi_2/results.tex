\chapter{Governing parameters of  fluid-elastic galloping}
\label{chap:goven_para}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter contains the formulation of non dimensional governing parameters namely, the combined mass-stiffness \massstiff \ and the combined mass-damping \massdamp \ and the results and discussion demonstrating the influence of them. These parameters are formulated by obtaining the relevant time-scales of the system followed by non-dimesnionlising the governing QSS oscillator equation.  

A comparison of Quasi-steady state data presented using the classical VIV parameters and the newly formulated \massstiff \ and \massdamp is presented and it is concluded that \massdamp provides a better collapse for velocity amplitude and mean power compared the classical reduced velocity (\ustar) particularly because unlike \ustar, \massdamp \ does not include a frequency component in it. This is followed by the presentation of QSS data and discussion on the influence of \massstiff \ and \massdamp \ on power, which concludes that the power transfer is a primary function of \massdamp \ and a weak function of \massstiff.

Following this, a comparison of the QSS data with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) is presented. This reveals that the power transfer of the DNS data is strongly influenced by both \massstiff \ and \massdamp. Further analysis reveals that there is a good agreement between QSS and DNS for velocity and power at substantially high \massstiff\. As \massstiff \ decreases, the deviation (between QSS simulations and DNS) increases. Power spectral analysis of the DNS data shows a significant response at the vortex shedding at low \massstiff. The relative strength was found out to be an inverse function of \massstiff, which provides a clear explanation for the deviation between QSS simulations and DNS data at low \massstiff. This is primarily due to the influence of vortex shedding where this effect is not accounted in the QSS model.


\section{Formulation of the non-dimensionalised parameters \massstiff \ and \massdamp }
\label{sec: pi_1,pi_2_formulation}

The natural time scales of the system could be obtained by linearising the quasi-steady equation of motion. (Eq:\KJ{equation of motion}) and finding the eigenvalues. The non-linear terms of the forcing function are truncated and the equation of motion could be expressed as, 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:eom_linear}
m\ddot{y}{+}c\dot{y}{+}ky{=}\frac{1}{2}\rho U^2 \mathcal{A} a_1\left(\frac{\dot{y}}{U}\right),
\end{equation}

After combining the $\dot{y}$ terms and solving for eigenvalues the following solutions for the eigenvalues could be obtained. 

 \begin{equation}
 \label{eqn:eigs}
 \lambda_{1,2}= -\frac{1}{2}\frac{c-\frac{1}{2}\rho U\mathcal{A}a_1}{m}\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\left[\frac{c-\frac{1}{2}\rho U\mathcal{A}a_1}{(m)}\right]^2-4\frac{k}{m}}.
 \end{equation} 
 
 Galloping essentially occurs at low frequencies therefore it can be assumed that the spring is relevantly weak and therefore, $k \rightarrow 0$. Hence a single non-zero eigenvalue remains which is, 
  
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:eigs_nospring}
  \lambda=-\frac{c-\frac{1}{2}\rho U\mathcal{A}a_1}{m}.
  \end{equation}
  
  Further, if it is assumed that the mechanical damping is weaker than the fluid dynamic forces on the body the non zero eigenvalue could be further simplified to,
  
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eqn:eigs_nospring_nodamp}
 \lambda=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\rho U\mathcal{A}a_1}{m}.
 \end{equation}  

In this representation $\lambda$ represents the inverse time scale of the motion of the body due to the effect of long-time fluid dynamic forces (or forced due to the induced velocity). This term could also be re-written and $\lambda$ could be expressed as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:timescale}
\lambda = \frac{a_1}{m^*}\frac{U}{D}
\end{equation}

This form clearly shows the significant parameters that influences the inverse time scale of the system. $\partial C_Y / \partial \alpha $, the rate of change in the fluid dynamic force on the body, with respect to the induced angle of attack, is represented by $a_1$. $\frac{U}{D}$ represents the inverse advective time scale of the incoming flow, and the mass ratio is resented by \mstar. Increasing $a_1$ would result in a rapid change of the fluid dynamic force with a small change of the induced angle $\theta$, which is proportional to transverse velocity $\dot{y}$. It can be seen in equation \ref{eqn:timescale} that an increase of $a_{1}$ would result in an increase of the inverse time scale or decrease the response time of the body. In contrast the mass ratio has the opposite effect where an increase in \mstar will lead to a decrease in $\lambda$, since a heavier body (or a body with higher inertia) would have a slower response. 

In order to find the relevant dimensionless groups of the problem, the time scale formulated could be used to non-dimensionalise the equation of motion. The equation of motion presented in Equation \KJ{put final equation of motion} can be non-dimensionalised using the non dimensional time $\tau$, defined as $\tau=t(a_1/m^*)(U/D)$. The non-dimensional equation of motion could then be represented as, 

 \begin{equation}
 \label{eqn:eom_nondim}
 \ddot{Y} + \frac{m^{*2}}{a_1^2}\frac{kD^2}{mU^2}Y = \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{m^*}{a_1}\frac{cD}{mU}\right)\dot{Y} - \frac{a_1A_3}{m^{*2}}\dot{Y}^3 + \frac{a_1^3a_5}{m^{*4}}\dot{Y}^5 - \frac{a_1^5a_7}{m^{*6}}\dot{Y}^7.
 \end{equation}
 
 The equation could be further altered by regrouping the coefficients into non-dimenasional groups and could be expressed as, 
 
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:eom_nondim_regroup}
  \ddot{Y} + \frac{4\pi^{2}m^{*2}}{U^{*2}a_1^2}Y = \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{c^*m^*}{a_1}\right)\dot{Y} - \frac{a_1A_3}{m^{*2}}\dot{Y}^3 + \frac{a_1^3a_5}{m^{*4}}\dot{Y}^5 - \frac{a_1^5a_7}{m^{*6}}\dot{Y}^7,
  \end{equation}  

\ustar is the reduced velocity which is the typical independent variable ussed in vortex-induced vibration studies. \cstar is the non-dimensional damping parameter which is expressed as $c^*=cD/mU$. 

By analysing equation \ref{eqn:eom_nondim_regroup} it is clear that five dimensionless parameters play a role in setting the response of the system. These are namely the stiffness, damping, mass ratio, the geometry and the Reynolds number. The stiffness is repented by the reduced velocity \ustar, the damping by \cstar and the mass ratio by \mstar. The geometry and the Reynolds number are represented by the coefficients $a_n$, of the polynomial fit to the $C_y$ curve. Using the natural time scales of the system, grouping of these non-dimensional parameters into two groups in the non-dimensional equation of motion, suggests that there are two groups that governs the response which are: $\Gamma_1 = 4\pi^2m^{*2}/U^{*2}a_1^2$ and $\Gamma_2 = c^*m^*/a_1$. $\Gamma_1$ could be described as a combined mass-stiffness, where $\Gamma_2$ could be expressed as a combined mass-damping parameter for a given geometry and a Reynolds number. It is assumed that the stiffness plays a minor role, $\Gamma_2$ seems more likely parameter to collapse the data. The wind tunnel data in the classic paper of galloping by \citep{Parkinson1964} adopted a parameter similar to $\Gamma_2$ to collapse the data. 

All of the quantities that formulate $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ except $a_1$ in theory, could be obtained before an experiment. However in order to obtain the value of $a_1$ static body experiments are required making it relatively difficult to obtain. Here, the \reynoldsnumber and the geometry remains constant and therefore multiplying $\Gamma_1$ with ${a_1}^2$ and $\Gamma_2$ with $a_1$ suitable parameters could be obtained, and formulate a mass-stiffness parameter $\massstiff =  4\pi^2m^{*2}/U^{*2}$, and a mass-damping parameter defined as $\massdamp = c^*m^*$. Therefore equation \ref{eqn:eom_nondim_regroup} can be written in terms of \massstiff \ and \massdamp. 

  \begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:eom_nondim_regroup_pi_1_pi_2}
  \ddot{Y} + \massstiff Y = \massdamp \dot{Y} - \frac{a_1a_3}{m^{*2}}\dot{Y}^3 + \frac{a_1^3a_5}{m^{*4}}\dot{Y}^5 - \frac{a_1^5a_7}{m^{*6}}\dot{Y}^7,
  \end{equation} 
  
From equation \ref{eqn:eom_nondim_regroup_pi_1_pi_2}, it is clear that the governing parameters of the non dimensionlised equation are \massstiff \ \massdamp and \mstar. However, form closer inspection it is possible to see that \mstar has an impact on the non-linear terms of the forcing function. The velocity pf the and hence the induced angle of attack needs to be very high in order for the non-linear terms to be applicable. 

\section{Quasi-steady state results}
\label{sec:qss_results} 

\subsection{Classical VIV parameters vs. \massstiff \ and \massdamp.}
\label{subsec:compare_data}


Vortex-induced vibrations being another form fluid-structure interaction which occurs in a slender structure, has been investigated as candidate for power extraction from external flows. Significant progress on this problem have been made by \cite{Bernitsas2008a-concept,Bernitsas2009,Raghavan2010a,Lee2011b} and other colleagues in VIVCACE group in the University of Michigan. Hence, it may seem that it is reasonable to present the data in a fluid-elastic problem using the same parameters in a VIV problem.

\input{./chapter-pi_1_pi_2/figure/compare_data}

QSS data presented in figure \ref{fig:compare_data} at $\reynoldsnumber=200$, shows a comparison between classical VIV and the newly formulated parameters presented as independent variables. The displacement amplitude, velocity amplitude and the mean power is presented in sub-figures (a), (c) and (e), as functions of the classical VIV parameter \ustar for different $\zeta$. The same data as functions of \massdamp, are presented in sub-figures (b), (d) and (f), for various, reasonably high values of \massstiff \KJ{put the parameters used section}. Sub-figure (e) shows a similar trend to \cite{Barrero-Gil2010a}. The Value of the peak power remains constant. However, the power curve shifts to the right as $\zeta$ is increased. Here, in figure \ref{fig:compare_data} the maximum dimensionless power is achieved at two times the velocity at which the galloping starts, which is similar to the observations made by \citet{Barrero-Gil2010a,vicente-Ludlam2014}. An excellent collapse for velocity amplitude and mean power could be observed on the data, presented using the dimensionless group \massdamp, formulated using the natural time scales of the system. This implies that essentially velocity amplitude and the mean power is dictated by \massdamp which furthermore, implies that the natural frequency of the system which is used to scale \ustar, $\zeta$ and \massstiff does not have a significant influence on the behaviour of the system, unlike VIV, which is a resonant phenomenon.  
 

\subsection{High and low \reynoldsnumber \ data}
\label{subsec:high_Re_data}

\input{./chapter-pi_1_pi_2/figure/collapsed_data}

The successful collapse of data, mean power in particular using \massdamp for low Reynolds number ($\reynoldsnumber=200$), could be replicated at high Reynolds numbers. An example case is presented in figure \ref{fig:compare_data} at $\reynoldsnumber=22300$ for selected vales of \massstiff. The successful collapse of mean power data at high Reynolds numbers shows that suitability of using \massdamp \ as an independent variable across a large range of Reynolds numbers. 

Hysteresis is evident in the high Reynolds number case ($\reynoldsnumber=22300$). Manipulating the initial condition (initial displacement) lead to obtaining different solutions for the same \massdamp \ value. The upper and lower branch were obtained by giving an initial displacement which was higher than the expected amplitude and providing a lower initial displacement respectively. Even though in theory, there is a possibility of a third state, this unstable branch could not be achieved with a time integration method (also observed by \citep{Vio2007}) such as the one employed in this study.

\subsection{Dependence on mass-stiffness, \massstiff}
\label{subsec:dependence pi_1}

\input{./chapter-pi_1_pi_2/figure/high_pi_1}

From the results of sections \ref{subsec:compare_data} and \ref{subsec:high_Re_data} shows essentially a single variable governs the mean extracted power, which is the combined mass-damping parameter, \massdamp. The time scale analysis carried out in  section \ref{sec: pi_1,pi_2_formulation} shows that not only \massdamp \ but also \massstiff influences the system. Previous studies such as \cite{bouclin:77} have also reported a complex interaction between the displacement amplitude and the natural frequency, for high natural frequencies in particular; or in this instance equivalent to low values of \massstiff.  This section investigates the impact of \massstiff further. The overall behavior of the system is divided into two regimes, one for ``high" \massstiff \ and the other for ``low" \massstiff and analysed.

The mean power as a function of \massdamp \ for a range of values of \massstiff is presented in figure \ref{fig:high_pi_1}. In the two subfigures presented, (a) shows the data for $\massstiff \geq 10$, while (b) shows data for $\massstiff \leq 10$.  The excellent collapse in figure \ref{fig:high_pi_1}(a) shows that for $\massstiff \geq 10$, the mean power is independent of \massstiff.

In contrast figure \ref{fig:high_pi_1}(b) shows that for low values of $\massstiff \leq 10$, the predicted mean power increases as \massdamp \ decreases. This indicates that at this region ($\massstiff < 10$), the mean power is a weak function of \massstiff; hence, providing a distinction between high and low regimes of \massstiff. The mean extracted power is only a function of \massdamp \ where $\massstiff \geq 10$ or for high \massstiff. For low values, $\massstiff < 10$, the mean power becomes a strong function of \massdamp \ and a weak function of \massstiff.

It is clear that regardless of the value of \massstiff, the variation of power with \massdamp \ is essentially the same. As \massdamp \ is increased, the mean extracted power will increase to the point which, it will attain some maximum value and then decrease. This relationship between power and \massdamp \ could be explained by analysing the time histories of selected cases. 
AS an example, data at $\massstiff=10$, $m^*=20$ and $\reynoldsnumber=200$ are presented in figure \ref{fig:power_time_histories}. Three major regions where the value of the power curve are considered. These regions are \massdamp\ less than (region 1), equal to (region 2) and greater than (region 3) to the \massdamp\ value where the mean power is at its maximum.

\input{./chapter-pi_1_pi_2/figure/time_histories}

The damping is low is low in region 1 ($\massdamp=0.15$) in comparison with region 2 and 3. Although this may lead to larger oscillations, according to equation \ref{eqn:power} damping is required to dissipate and therefore extract power. Hence, a low mean power output is gained at low damping. The high velocity amplitude leads the equivalent incident angle $\theta$ to exceed the positive range of $C_y$ (i.e. $0<\theta<6^\circ$ as shown in figure\ref{cy ploynomial}(a)) resulting a negative dissipated power by damping $P_d$ over some portion of the cycle as shown in figure \ref{fig:power_time_histories} (a). The galloping force $F_y$ and the transverse velocity $\dot{y}$ are not in phase in this portion of the cycle where the force opposes the direction of travel. As a consequence, during this period of time the opposite of what is expected happens, where the power is transferred from the structure to the fluid. Since \massdamp \ is substantially low, from an energy perspective, the mechanical damping is not sufficient to remove the energy transferred from the fluid to the structure through work during other times of the cycle. Hence, as depicted by the negative region of $P_d$, this excess energy is transferred back to the fluid.



A clear sinusoidal signal of both $P_d$ and $P_t$ (\ref{fig:power_time_histories}(c)) could be observed at region 3 where $\massdamp=0.8$ and the damping constant is high. The equivalent incident angle $\theta$ (which for small values, is proportional to the transverse velocity of the body) is in phase with the galloping force $F_y$ as shown in figures \ref{fig:power_time_histories}(f) and  \ref{fig:power_time_histories}(i). The velocity amplitude is small in this case resulting $\theta$ falling within the rage where the fluid-dynamic force ($F_y$) increases within the incident angle (i.e. $0<\theta \leq 5^\circ$ as shown in figure \ref{fig:lift_curves}(a)). These conditions are favourable for high power output according to equation \ref{power_alt}. Be that as it may, in this case the velocity is limited because of the high damping resulting relativity low fluid dynamic forcing. 

A harmony between the high and low values of damping could be found at region 2  ( $\massdamp=0.54$). It is evident that $P_d$ remains periodic but is not a pure sinusoidal signal. Two `peaks' are present in a single half cycle from the time history graph of $P_d$ as shown in figure \ref{fig:power_time_histories}(b). The velocity amplitude actually exceeds the equivalent incident angle where the fluid-dynamic forces peaks (i.e. $\theta=5^\circ$ in \ref{cy ploynomial} (a)) in this scenario. The dip in between the two peaks in a single half cycle correspond approximately to the time where the transverse velocity is higher that 0.09 and $F_y$ is decreasing with increasing transverse velocity. As this region is the best compromise between region 1 and region 3, the maximum mean power could be attained in this region. Region 2 could also be identified as the ``sweet spot" for energy extraction as the damping is high enough to obtained a high power output while not so high for the motion to be completely suppressed. 


\subsection{Dependence on the mass ratio \mstar}
\label{sec:chp-pi_1_pi2_mstar}


It is clear that the mean extracted power is only a function of \massdamp \ for high values of \massstiff. However, the question remains about the region of low \massstiff. Does the variation of the mean extracted power occur purely as a function of \massstiff, or does the mass ratio also has an influence on power? The QSS model was solved by varying the values for \mstar
but keeping the \massstiff fixed. In other words \massstiff\ was changed by changing the stiffness of the system. 
 
It is clear from figure \ref{fig:low_pi_1}, data presented being the mean extracted power  as a function of \massdamp, for a fixed $\massstiff = 0.1$, for three different values of \mstar, that mean power is independent of \mstar, hence, it is only a function of \massstiff\ and \massdamp.

\input{./chapter-pi_1_pi_2/figure/low_pi_1}


\subsection{Comparison with DNS data}
\label{sec:chp-pi_1_pi2_dns}

The main drawback of the QSS model is that the instantaneous lift generated by the induced velocity is the only driving force of the system. However, in realistic scenarios the flow is far more complex and the only force affecting the system is not the induce lift. Force generated due to vortex shedding is one of the prominent forces in these systems. Hence, when the QSS model is being used, one of the essential assumptions is that the effect of vortex shedding is minimal. Due to this reason the model has been always used at high Reynolds numbers and at high \mstar. Therefore, a study to identify the limiting parameters of the QSS model at low Reynolds numbers was carried out  using a comparison of QSS data with DNS results.


% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % 

A sinusoidal forcing function was introduced to the QSS model in order to account for the forcing by vortex shedding by \citet{Joly2012}. In this study displacement data obtained by the QSS model and the DNS simulations were compared which agreed well at low Reynolds numbers. The data were obtained at zero damping levels. As the primary focus of this study is the behaviour and the power transfer of the system, analysing the behaviour of the system with increasing damping is of interest.   

Figure \ref{fig:qss_fsi} provides a comparison between QSS and the DNS results.The maximum displacement, velocity and mean extracted power are presented as a function of \massdamp. A range of values of \massstiff\ are compared to the QSS model data for $\massstiff = 10$. Only little variation with \massstiff \ could be found in  the displacement amplitude (figure\ref{fig:qss_fsi}(a)) and velocity amplitude (\ref{fig:qss_fsi}(b)). Thus the comparison between the QSS model and the DNS simulation is quite satisfactory for these two quantities. In contrast, there is a significant influence of both \massstiff\ and \massdamp\ on the mean extracted power which is  presented in figure \ref{fig:qss_fsi}(c). This discrepancy become more vivid in the regions where the value of \massstiff\ is low. These regions has the largest discrepancy between the QSS model and DNS data. A comparison of data between figures \ref{fig:qss_fsi}(c) and \ref{fig:high_pi_1}(a) shows that \massstiff has a much more significant influence on the extracted power than the predictions by the QSS model for low \massstiff\ values. Indeed as discussed in section \ref{subsec:dependence pi_1} the QSS model predicts that the mean extracted power should increase with decreasing \massstiff\ when \massstiff\ moves to the low \massstiff\ region (figure \ref{fig:high_pi_1}(b)). However, the DNS data show sort of an opposite result where the extracted mean power decreases with decreasing \massstiff.


\input{./chapter-pi_1_pi_2/figure/qss_fsi}


% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %

The dependence of the mean extracted power on \massstiff\ is clearly shown in figure \ref{fig:max_power}(a).  Here, the maximum power extracted for a given value of \massstiff, over all values of \massdamp (essentially the value of extracted power at the turning point), is plotted as a function of \massstiff. A quadratic fit was used obtain these values presented in figure \ref{fig:low_pi_1} and finding the mean extracted power at the turning point of the power curve. It is clear that there is a rapid decrease in extracted power as $\massstiff \rightarrow 0$. 

\input{./chapter-pi_1_pi_2/figure/max_power}





Figure \ref{fig:max_power}(a) also shows that \massstiff\ is important to higher values than predicted by the QSS model. For the QSS model, the mean extracted power was essentially independent of \massstiff\ for $\massstiff>10$, as shown by the open symbols on the figure. However, the mean extracted power from the DNS data shows a significant dependence on \massstiff\ for $\massstiff<250$. Even so, the power extracted during the DNS simulations converges to the value predicted by the QSS model as \massstiff\ increases.

Figure \ref{fig:max_power}(b) shows the value of \massdamp\ at which the turning point, and therefore the maximum power output, occurs. The open symbols show the value predicted by the QSS model, the closed symbols show the value predicted by the DNS. The two are not the same, with a value around $0.41$ predicted by the DNS (shown with a dashed line) and a value above $0.5$ predicted by the QSS model. However, both models show that while the power extracted is a reasonably strong function of \massstiff, the value of \massdamp\ at which this maximum power occurs is relatively unaffected.


% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %
In an effort to further quantify the performance of the QSS model, the percentage between the QSS and DNS extracted power data as a function of \massstiff\ was calculated using the equation
\begin{equation}   \label{eqn:error_calculation} 
\% \ error=\left|{\frac{P_{m(QSS)} - P_{m(DNS)}}{P_{m(DNS)}}}\right| \times 100.
\end{equation}

The results of this calculation are plotted in figure \ref{fig:error}, along with a power-law best fit $138.697\massstiff^{-0.6}$. The figure clearly shows that as \massstiff \ increases, the error between the QSS and DNS models quickly decreases. However, at low values of \massstiff, the discrepancy between the two can be quite large, around $30\%$.

\input{./chapter-pi_1_pi_2/figure/error}

A likely reason for this discrepancy at low \massstiff\ is the influence of the vortex shedding, which is not accounted for in the QSS model. To investigate this further, frequency spectra for the body velocity from DNS cases at varying values of \massstiff, at a value of $\massdamp=0.47$ (close to the value at which the mean extracted power is a maximum), have been produced. They are presented, along with the original time histories in figure \ref{fig:spectrum}.

\input{./chapter-pi_1_pi_2/figure/spectrum}

This figure shows the  velocity signals at $\massstiff=0.8$ and $\massdamp= 10, 60, 250$ and $1000$ and the corresponding spectrum. The spectral data shows a significant component around $fd/U=0.156$ which can be identified as the vortex shedding frequency. The magnitude of the component at the vortex shedding frequency clearly reduces as \massstiff\ is increased. This indicates that the influence of vortex shedding is much more prominent at low \massstiff,  therefore resulting in larger deviations from quasi-steady state results. This builds on the work of \cite{Joly2012}, which was conducted at zero damping, that implied that mean extracted power would be influenced by vortex shedding at low mass.

This influence is explicitly shown here. Figure \ref{fig:spec_pow} plots the relative intensity of the component at the vortex shedding frequency to the component at the galloping or oscillation frequency in the spectra of figure \ref{fig:spectrum}.

\input{./chapter-pi_1_pi_2/figure/spec_pow}



Similar to the discrepancy between the QSS and DNS mean extracted power shown in figure \ref{fig:error}, the relative strength of the vortex shedding is seen to be large at small values of \massstiff, and quickly decreases as \massstiff\ is increased. The figure shows that the relative power of the vortex shedding frequency to the galloping frequency varies like $0.977\massstiff^{-0.52}$.

The difference between the power predicted by the QSS and DNS models scales with $\massstiff^{-0.6}$; the relative power at the vortex shedding frequency scales with $\massstiff^{-0.52}$. These scalings are quite similar, and both are close to $1/\sqrt{\massstiff}$. While not unequivocal, this correlation strongly indicates this discrepancy is due to the influence of the vortex shedding, even though the vortex shedding and galloping frequencies remain separated by around the same amount for all values of \massstiff\ presented in figure \ref{fig:spectrum}. The data presented in figure \ref{fig:spec_pow} also give some indication of the strength of any vortex shedding correction term that might be added to the QSS model in an effort to decrease the discrepancy between it and the DNS simulations.

\input{./chapter-pi_1_pi_2/figure/flow_vis}

Further information can be gained by observing the flow field. Flow field data at values of \massdamp\ close to where maximum power is produced at different \massstiff\ are presented in figure \ref{fig:flow_vis}. The figure shows a clear wavelength of the wake as \massstiff \ is increased. Qualitatively, this can be interpreted as showing that at high \massstiff, the vortex shedding is simply superimposed over the path of motion of the cylinder. It shows a decrease in amplitude at low \massstiff, which may be due to the higher levels of non-linear interaction between the vortex shedding and galloping. Such an argument is conistant with the data of figure \ref{fig:spec_pow} that show the increasing significance of vortex shedding as \massstiff\ decreases. Taken together, this also goes some way to explaining the discrepancy between the output power predicted by the QSS and DNS models at low \massstiff, highlighted in figure \ref{fig:error}.
