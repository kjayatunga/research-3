\section{Fluid-elastic galloping}

Fluid-elastic galloping is one of the most commonly observable flow-induced vibration on a slender body. Since this phenomenon is most common in civil structure, such as buildings and iced-transmission lines, the term ``aeroelastic galloping" is commonly used as the body is immersed in air. However, this mechanism can occur on a slender body immersed in any Newtonian fluid, provided that the conditions to sustain the galloping mechanism are satisfied. This work is based on a general Newtonian flow,thus the term `` fluid-elastic galloping" is used throughout this thesis.
   

\subsection{Excitation of galloping}

When a bluff body moves along the transverse direction of the fluid flow, it generates a force along the transverse direction. This force, also known as the induced lift is a resultant of the velocity of the fluid and the motion of the body. When this body is attached to an oscillating system (i.e. a simple spring, mass and damper system), the induced lift becomes the periodic forcing of the system. Galloping is sustained  if the induced lift is in phase with the motion of the body. This could be explained further by using a square cross section as an example.

 Figure \ref{fig:induced_lift_sketch}  illustrates the motion of the body at a given instantaneous time.The induced angle of attack is formed on the square cross section as a result of the fressrteam velocity vector $U$ and the transverse velocity vector of the body $\dot{y}$. Thus, a force is formed in phase with the motion of the body (square cross section). This mechanism could also be observed on other bodies which are prone to galloping. The sign convention in this figure (and generally used in this scope of research) states that downward direction is positive. Hence, the force generated on a body under the influence of galloping, could be also identified as a ``negative lift".
 

\subsection{Qusasi-state theory}


According \cite{Paidoussis2010},the initial studies by \cite{Glauert1919} provided a criterion for galloping by considering the auto-rotation of a stalled aerofoil. As this phenomenon commonly occur in iced transmission lines, \cite{DenHartog1956} has provided a theoretical explanation for iced electric transmission lines. 

The pioneering study in order to mathematically model galloping was conducted by \cite{Parkinson1964}. This model has been widely used in almost all subsequent studies regarding galloping. A weakly non-linear oscillator model was developed by them to predict the response of the system. Essentially the quasi-steady assumption was made to develop this theory assuming that the instantaneous induced lift force of the oscillating body is equal to that of the lift force generated by the same body at the same induced angle of attack. In order to satisfy the quasi-steady assumption few conditions had to be satisfied.

\begin{itemize}
 \item The velocity of the body does not change rapidly
 \item There is no interaction between vortex shedding and galloping
\end{itemize}

The second condition is satisfied by ensuring the vortex shedding frequency is much higher than the galloping frequency.
The oscillator equation was solved using the Krylov and Bogoliubov method. Details of this method would not be mentioned as it is not used in the present study to solve the oscillator equation. The results obtained form experiments, carried out at $\reynoldsnumber=2200$ and a mass ratio (\mstar) around 1164 had a good agreement with the theoretical data which is shown in figure \ref{fig:parkinson_paper_data}.

\subsection{Induced force and the shear layers}

It is important to have an understanding on how the induced lift is generated in a fluid dynamics point of view. Since the quasi-steady model has already been validated and re-validated by many studies, the flow-field data of static body simulations of a square cross section, at different angle of attack is used as an example.
