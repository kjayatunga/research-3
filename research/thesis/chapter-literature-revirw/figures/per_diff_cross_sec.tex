  \caption{ ``The transverse force coefficient for various sections in steady smooth or turbulent flow (after \citet{Blevins1990})" obtained from \citet{Paidoussis2010}.Here the induced angle is represented by $\alpha$ and the transverse force force coefficient is represented by $C_{fy}$. In order for galloping to sustain, the direction of both of these quantities should be same this thus have to satisfy the condition of $\frac{\partial C_{fy}}{\partial \alpha } >0$}
