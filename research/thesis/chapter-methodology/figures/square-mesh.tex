 \caption{Macro element arrangement in the domain for the square cross section geometry. The inlet extending  $20D$ upstream from the centre of the body, while the outlet extends $60D$ downstream from the centre of the body. The lateral boundaries were placed $20D$ away from the centre of the body.}
