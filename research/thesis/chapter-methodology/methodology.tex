\section{Introduction}
 
A brief overview of the computational methods to perform the simulations to obtain the data in this thesis are are presented in this chapter. As the this particular study is not focused on developing computational methods but concentrated on understanding the physics of a body under the influence of fluid-elastic galloping, it should be noted that the overview provided in this chapter is quite abstract.
