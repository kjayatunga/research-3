\chapter{Methodology and validation}

\section{Introduction}
 
A brief overview of the computational methods to perform the simulations to obtain the data in this thesis are are presented in this chapter. As the this particular study is not focused on developing computational methods but concentrated on understanding the physics of a body under the influence of fluid-elastic galloping, it should be noted that the overview provided in this chapter is quite abstract.

The flow of this chapter is as follows. First the equations used to model the system are presented and discussed. Next, the a brief discussion of the direct numerical simulation is presented followed by the problem formulation and the discussion of the parameters used. 

Finally, a series of validation data are presented and discussed to ensure the accuracy of the direct numerical simulations in order to ensure the confidence in the numerical predictions of this thesis.

\section{Quasi-steady model}
\label{sec:QSS_model_methodology}

The quasi-steady state model discussed in section \ref{sec:QSS theory} was used to obtain oscillator response data. The quasi-steady state model has proven its ability to obtain accurate galloping response data (discussed in section \ref{sec:QSS theory}). Therefore, it enables to obtain large number of data at a short computational time.
