  \caption{Contours of the magnitude of the shear strain rate of time averaged flow field on the  stationary isosceles triangle ($\ratio=0$) at $\reynoldsnumber=200$ at different incidence angles. (a) $4^{\circ}$ ( negative value of \cy\ that is further decreasing with increasing $\theta$), (b) $16^{\circ}$ ( negative value of \cy\ that is increasing with increasing $\theta$) and (c) $21^{\circ}$ $\theta$ and a significantly positive value of \cy. The bottom shear layer comes closer to the bottom wall and as the angle of incidence increases.}
