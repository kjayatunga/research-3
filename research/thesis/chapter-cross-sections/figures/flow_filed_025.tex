  \caption{Time averaged stream functions of stationary and oscillating flow-fields of the hybrid cross section ($\ratio=0.25$), averaged over a vortex shedding cycle. (a), (c) and (e) the averaged stream functions of the oscillating case at $t=2295.763$ (point 1), $t=2305.897$ (point 2) and $t=2325.870$ (point 3) . (b), (d) and (f) are the stream functions of the flow field of the stationary body corresponding to the induced angles of (a), (c) and (e).}
