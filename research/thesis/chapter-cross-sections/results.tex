\chapter{Influence of fluid dynamics of the system on the extracted power}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter contains the results and discussion relating to the third objective of this thesis. As discussed in chapter \ref{chap:lit-review} the induced force $F_y$ of the system is a result of the top and bottom of the shear layer behaviour of the system. Therefore, current published work shows that the afterbody of the system has a significant influence on the galloping response. In this chapter, the influence of shear layer behaviour and hence, the influence of the afterbody on mean extracted power is discussed.
