\chapter{Influence of fluid dynamics of the system on the extracted power}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter contains the results and discussion relating to the third objective of this thesis. As discussed in chapter \ref{chap:lit-review} the induced force $F_y$ of the system is a result of the top and bottom of the shear layer behaviour of the system. The current published work shows that the afterbody of the system has a significant influence on the galloping response. In this chapter, the influence of shear layer behaviour and hence, the influence of the afterbody on mean extracted power is discussed.

Here, the influence of shear layer on the mean power is studied by introducing a cross section which is a hybrid of a square and a triangle. Data are analysed the cross section is transformed gradually by manipulating the ratio of two length scales.

The stationary forcing data is presented for each cross section followed by the QSS power curves. Based on the QSS power data, an optimum cross section for power extraction is identified. Next, the underpinning reason for the negative portion of certain $C_y$ curves is discussed through surface pressure and flow velocity data. Following this, a reasoning for the discrepancy between QSS and DNS mean power at the optimum power cross section is discussed.       

A final summary is presented explaining the influence of the shear layer on mean power output and the preliminary design considerations to optimise the fluid mechanics to obtain an optimum power output. 


\section{Influence of the shear layers}

As highlighted in section \ref{subsec:fluid_mechanics_of_galloping} the afterbody of the cross section has a significant influence on galloping. This is because of the shear layer need to interact with the afterbody after separation at the leading edge. 


The $C_y$ vs $\alpha$ curve increases reaches a maximum and reduces as the induce angle is increased. The maximum of the induced lift occurs when the separated  shear layer (at the leading edge) closer to the surface of the body reattaches at the trailing edge. Therefore, by delaying the reattachment the point where the maximum lift occurs can be shifted towards a higher induced angle which leads to a higher induced velocity. As shown in equation \ref{eqn:power_alt} higher velocity leads to higher power output. In order to test this hypothesis the shear layer reattachment was reduced by gradually tapering off the top and bottom sides of the square cross section as sown in figure \ref{fig:hybrid_section}. The $\ratio$ was changed gradually from 1 to zero at increments of 0.25 where 1 being the square cross section and 0 being an isosceles triangle.

\section{Static body results}
 \label{sec:cross-sec-Static body results}
\input{./chapter-cross-sections/figures/coefficient-table.tex}

Stationary $C_y$ results were obtained for cross sections where $\ratio=1,0.75,0.5,0.25,0$. Where $\ratio=1$ being the square and $\ratio=0$ being an isosceles  triangle. Table \ref{table:cy-coefficients-hybrid} shows the coefficients of the $7^{th}$ order interpolation polynomial for each cross section. In order to achieve a better fit, piecewise interpolation using multiple $7th$ order polynomials were incorporated for a single cross section. During the curve fitting process more importance was given to the positive portion of the $C_{y}$ curve as this portion of the data ensures that the galloping is sustained. 

\input{./chapter-cross-sections/figures/lift_curves.tex}

The $C_y$ vs. $\alpha$ curves in figure \ref{fig:lift_curves-hybrid} shows that the peak value of \cy\ shifts to the right as $\theta$ is increased. As $\theta$ is proportional to the transverse velocity of the body $tan{\theta}=\frac{\dot{y}}{U}$, it is clear that the maximum \cy\ occur at higher velocities as \ratio\ is decreased which was an expected outcome. Another interesting observation is that the presence of a negative portion prior to the point of maximum \cy\ in the \cy\ vs. $\theta$ curves as \ratio\ is decreased. In this region, \cy\ decreases reaches a minimum and then increases as $\theta$ is increased. The absolute value of the maximum is grater than the absolute value of the minimum. This negative portion starts to emerge at $\ratio=0.25$. However, the maximum value of \cy\ increases as \ratio\ is decreased providing an indication of a possibility of attaining a higher power output at low \ratio.

Yet, it is to be noted that the presence of the negative portion of the lift curve will oppose the motion of the body where the velocity of the body and the driving force will be out of phase. This will lead to an energy transfer from the body to the fluid which is the opposite of the expectations resulting a reduction in mean power output.

 \section{QSS results}
  \label{sec:cross-sec-QSS}
  
 \subsection{Mean power output}
 \label{subsec:cross-sec-qss-mean power}
 
\input{./chapter-cross-sections/figures/power_curves.tex}
 
Figure \ref{fig:power_curves} shows the mean power \massdamp\ vs. mean power for different cross sections namely $\ratio=1,0.75,0.5,0.25 \text{and} 0$. The shear layer reattachment is decreased as \ratio\ is decreased. The mean power increases as \ratio\ is decrease where a significant increase in the maximum power could be observed. This meets the expectations where it was hypothesised that the mean power would increase as the shear layer re-attachment is delayed. A rapid increase in mean power could be observed below $\ratio=0.5$.

As $\ratio$  decreases beyond $0.25$, as the mean power reaches the maximum a sudden drop could be observed as \massdamp\ is increased (eg. $\massdamp=0.39$ for $\ratio=0.25$). One interesting fact which could be observed is that the maximum power at $\ratio=0.25$ is larger that $\ratio=0$. This is against the expected outcome as the hypothesis was that by delaying the shear layer reattachment a higher mean power output could be gained.

It is clear that as discussed in section \ref{sec:cross-sec-Static body results} the negative portion of the $C_y$ curve influences this reduction in maximum power at $\ratio=0$ in comparison with $\ratio=0.25$. Comparing  the initial negative portion of the $\cy$ vs $\theta$ plot of $\ratio=0.25$ and $\ratio=0$ cross section, it is clear that the area of the initial negative region is high in $\ratio=0$ which effectively transfers large amount of energy from the body to the fluid and therefore resulting a low power output.  


\subsection{Surface pressure}
  \label{subsec:cross-sec-surface pressure}
  

In order to investigate further the cause of this negative region, surface pressure data of static DNS simulations were analysed of the isosceles triangle ($\ratio=0$) at $\theta=4^{\circ}$, $\theta=16^{\circ}$ and $\theta=21^{\circ}$. Theses points lies in regions where the negative portion increases, the negative portion desecrates and where \cy becomes positive respectively.   
  
\input{./chapter-cross-sections/figures/surf-pres.tex}

Figure \ref{fig:surf_pres} shows the surface pressure of the top and bottom surfaces of the body ($\ratio=0$) starting from  the leading edges. At $\theta=4^{\circ}$ The pressure of the bottom of the body is grater than the top. Therefore, a pressure difference is created and a force is generated in the upward direction which according to the sign convention presented in \ref{fig:induced_lift_sketch}, against the velocity of the body, hence giving a negative $\cy$. As $\theta$ (figure \ref{fig:surf_pres} (b)) is increased, at $16^{\circ}$ the gap between the surface pressure at the leading edge between the top and the bottom reduces. This effect results the increase in $\cy$ (although it is still in the negative region). As $\theta$ is further increased at $21^{\circ}$ (figure \ref{fig:surf_pres} (c)) the surface pressure on the top side becomes grater than the bottom. Therefore, the net effect of the pressure difference is a positive $\cy$ which the driving force $F_y$ is in phase with the velocity of the body. 

\subsection{Velocity profiles at the leading edges}

Having established that the cause of the initial negative region of the $\cy$ vs. $\theta$ plot was the pressure difference mainly at the leading edge of the top and bottom surfaces of the cross section, it was then further investigated the cause of this particular pressure difference.  
\input{./chapter-cross-sections/figures/tri-sketch.tex}

A key variable which directly relates to the pressure fluid in motion is the velocity of the fluid. The fundamentals of fluid dynamics state that pressure and velocity have an inversely proportional relationship in a Newtonian fluid. This is also evident in the Bernoulli's equation. Hence, analysis of the velocity at the edges of flow separation was performed to obtain a clear understanding about the cause of the pressure differences occurred.   


In order to obtain a clear picture of the behaviour of the velocity, velocity magnitude data were obtained along lines spreading outwards starting from the top and bottom edges of flow separation. A clear illustration of these lines are depicted in figure \ref{fig:tri-sketch} .The lengths of these lines were equal to unity (equal to the frontal projected hight of the body). Data were obtained for the same cases which the surface pressure data were obtained i.e. isosceles triangle ($\ratio=0$) at $\theta=4^{\circ}$, $\theta=16^{\circ}$ and $\theta=21^{\circ}$.

\input{./chapter-cross-sections/figures/vel-profile.tex}

The velocity profiles at the chosen three incident angles are presented in \ref{fig:vel-profile}. A sudden rise of velocity magnitude could be observed at the flow separation points. The velocity magnitude at the top separation point  at $\theta= 4^{0}$ (figure \ref{fig:vel-profile} (a)) is less than the bottom separation point, leading to a lower pressure at the top edge. However, the velocity magnitude at the bottom edge becomes grater than the top edge at $\theta=16^{\circ}$. The difference between the velocity magnitude tends to broaden as $\theta$ is increased to $21^{\circ}$, while the velocity magnitude at the bottom being grater than the top (figure \ref{fig:vel-profile} (c)). This effectively creates the pressure difference created in figure \ref{fig:surf_pres} (c), which leads to a positive \cy\ and results in a forcing which is in phase with the velocity of the body.  


\section{Fluid-structure interaction (DNS) results}

As discussed in section \ref{sec:chp-pi_1_pi2_dns} the main drawback of the QSS model is assuming that the only driving force of the system is $F_{y}$, which is generated from induced velocity. However, it was proved that this is not the case as vortex shedding have a significant influence with other non-linear disturbances on mean power as \massstiff\ decreases. Nevertheless, it was also concluded that a good agreement for power could be made at high \massstiff\ for the square cross section. Therefore, a comparison study between QSS and DNS mean power was carried out on the different cross section at high \massstiff\ ($=1000$). As it was evident from figure \ref{fig:power_curves} that the maximum power at $\ratio=0 < \ratio=0.25$ DNS mean power was  between $0.25\leq\ratio\leq1$. 

Both  DNS and QSS mean power data figure \ref{fig:DNS-power} show that \ratio\ decreases maximum mean extracted power increases following a similar trend. Thus these results reinforce the hypothesis for this section which is obtaining higher mean power by delaying the flow re-attachment. 

However, a significant error calculated using equation \ref{eqn:error_calculation} between QSS and DNS power could be observed as \ratio\ increased. The quantified errors presented in \ref{fig:error-hybrid} clearly shows the exponential increase in the $\%$ error as $\ratio \rightarrow 0.25$.
