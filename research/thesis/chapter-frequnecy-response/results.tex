\chapter{Frequency response of the system}

\section{Introduction}

The new governing parameters (\massstiff\ and \massdamp) formulated using the linearised QSS equation in chapter \ref{chap:goven_para} provide a good representation of velocity amplitude and mean power output. In this chapter, the new governing parameters are further analysed by investigating the impact of these parameters with galloping frequency response. 

The investigation into the frequency behaviour was carried out to compliment the understanding of \massstiff\ and \massdamp\ on galloping. 

The outline of this chapter is as follows. An expression for the frequency is formulated based on \massstiff\ and \massdamp\ through the natural time-scales of the system. The QSS model is used to simulate the system through to  extreme cases in order to find limits where a linear approximation could no longer predict frequency. This followed by the presentation of results through plots and contour plots in \massstiff\ and \massdamp\ space. Finally the limits of the formulated equation is identified and conclusions are made on the galloping frequency.

\section{Formulating the linear frequency of the system}

The process was initiated by considering the linearised galloping equation (Eq:\ref{eqn:eom_linear}). The eigenvalues of the linearised QSS model could be found in equation \ref{eqn:eigs}. The term under the square root (equation \ref{eqn:liner_freq}) of this equation can be used to express the frequency of the system provided that the eigenvalues are complex. 

If this condition (presence of complex eigenvalues)is satisfied, the imaginary component could be identified as the frequency of the system. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:liner_freq}
f = \sqrt{\left[\frac{c-\frac{1}{2}\rho U\mathcal{A}a_1}{(m)}\right]^2-4\frac{k}{(m)}}.
\end{equation}

By substituting \cstar, \mstar\ and \ustar equation \ref{eqn:liner_freq} could be non-dimensionalised as follows:

\begin{equation}
f = \sqrt{\left[c^*\left(\frac{U}{D}\right) - \frac{1}{2}\frac{a_1}{m^*}\left(\frac{U}{D}\right)\right]^2 - 4\left(\frac{U}{D}\right)^2\frac{2\pi}{U^*}}.
\end{equation}

This can then be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
f = \sqrt{\left(\frac{U}{D}\right)^2\left(c^*-\frac{a_1}{2m^*}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{U}{D}\right)^2\left(\frac{2\pi}{U^*}\right)^2}.
\end{equation}
By taking the factor of $U/D$ to the left-hand side
\begin{equation}
\frac{fD}{U} = \sqrt{\left(c^*-\frac{a_1}{2m^*}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{2\pi}{U^*}\right)^2}.
\end{equation}
Expanding terms gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{fD}{U} = \sqrt{c^{*2} - \frac{2c^*a_1}{2m^*} + \frac{a_1^2}{4m^{*2}} - \frac{16\pi^2}{U*^2}}.
\end{equation}
Multiplying through by $m*^2$ gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{fD}{U} = \sqrt{c^{*2}m^{*2} - c^*m^*a_1 + \frac{a_1^2}{4} - \frac{16\pi^2m{*^2}}{U^{*2}}}.
\end{equation}


By substituting \massstiff\ and \massdamp\ appropriately the expression of the linear frequency reduced to   
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:linear_freq_final}
\frac{fD}{U} = \sqrt{\Pi_2^2 - \Pi_2a_1 + \frac{a_1^2}{4} - 4\Pi_1}.
\end{equation}

Thus, from equation \ref{eqn:linear_freq_final} the non-dimensionalised linear frequency of the system could be expressed from the newly formulated terms, \massstiff\ and \massdamp.

\section{Frequency data}

The limiting factor of equation \ref{eqn:linear_freq_final} is the instance where it becomes a real number. Thus, certain questions arise. Does the QSS model \ref{final_equation_motion} predict a frequency beyond this point ?, i.e. after the RHS of eq:\ref{eqn:linear_freq_final} becomes real. If so, what governs the frequency ? Is this region realistic ? or in other words could this region be identified through DNS simulations. 

\subsection{Comparison of predicted frequencies using different approaches}

Using different techniques, namely predictions from linearised QSS equation, QSS modelling and DNS simulations, three different galloping frequencies were predicted namely \freqlin\ \freqqss\ and \freqdns. For a give value of \massstiff\ and \massdamp\, the linear frequency \freqlin\ was found by solving equation \ref{eqn:linear_freq_final}. \freqqss\ was obtained by performing a power spectrum analysis on the time trace of the velocity of the body  obtained by numerically solving the quasi-steady sate equation. \freqdns\ was obtained using the similar technique as \freqqss\ but the velocity data was obtained through DNS simulations of fluid-structure interactions. 

\input{./chapter-frequnecy-response/figures/freq-015.tex}

The different frequencies normalised by the undamped natural frequency $f$ as a function of \massstiff\ is presented in figure \ref{fig:pi2-015-freq}. It is to be noted that the undamped natural frequency was kept constant at $f=0.025$. The frequency obtained using DNS, \freqdns\ is the first to deviate followed by \freqqss\ and then \freqlin. The early deviation of \freqdns\ could be due to the non linear interaction between the galloping and other forms of forcing such as vortex shedding.

Given the circumstances two regions of frequency response could be identified namely, the linear region where  $f_{lin}>0$ and where \freqlin\ could no longer be predicted because the eigenvalues become real. The data of these two regions are discussed separately.

\subsection{Region where linear frequency can be predicted}

Figure \ref{eqn:liner_freq} shows the frequency ration between \freqlin\ and \freqqss\ at the region where $f_{lin}>0$. 
\input{./chapter-frequnecy-response/figures/flin-qss.tex}

The QSS frequency data tends to agree well between \freqlin\ and \freqqss\ for $\massstiff>10$ for almost all values of \massdamp. As \massstiff\ is further reduced the frequency ratio tends to reduce implying a further deviation between the frequencies.   

\input{./chapter-frequnecy-response/figures/fdns-flinear.tex}
 
 This pattern could also be observed for the DNS data (figure \ref{fig:feq-dns}). The two frequencies \freqlin\ and \freqdns\ tend to be in good agreement in the selected space of \massstiff\ and \massdamp\. It should be specially noted that the lower boundary of \massstiff\ was limited ($\massstiff=10$) because of the fact that galloping was weak in the DNS data where $\massstiff<10$, and no galloping frequency could be obtained with the power spectrum analysis. 


\subsection{Region where linear frequency could not be predicted}

This region is categorised as the region where no linear frequency can be predicted or in other words \freqlin is undefined. Even though there was no linear frequency predicted the QSS model provided a signal for velocity and displacement and therefore providing a frequency. 

\input{./chapter-frequnecy-response/figures/f-non-linear-fqss.tex}

The frequency ratio $\frac{f_{QSS}}{f}$ tends to deviate as \massstiff\ reduces (Figure \ref{fig:freq_non_linear}) implying a grater influence of the non-linear terms in the forcing. This region is where the QSS model was pushed to the very extreme end where very large values of \ustar was observed ($\mstar=20$ was kept constant). 

It is to be noted that this non-linear region may be difficult to set up physically and the strong vortex shedding in two dimensional simulations have suppressed galloping in this parameter space. Be that as it may, an in-depth analysis should be carried out using some other technique to isolate the weak galloping signal to back this argument. 

\section{Summary of the frequency response of the system}

An expression for the frequency of the system was formulated in terms of \massstiff\ and \massdamp\ together with the eigenvalues of the system from the linearised oscillator equation. The frequency obtained using this expression was termed linear frequency or \freqlin. Two frequency regions were identified namely the region where linear frequency can be predicted and could not be predicted. The linear frequency agreed well with the DNS results within the boundaries used in the region where a linear frequency could be predicted. The lower boundary of \massstiff\ was limited to $\massstiff=10$ as galloping got weaker and vortex shedding got more prominent. The QSS results agreed well for higher values of \massstiff\ in the linear frequency region but tends to deviate as \massstiff\ was reduced. 

QSS frequency was compared with the undamped natural frequency of the system $f$, in the region where a linear frequency was not predicted. This revealed that it was within $0.55\leq\frac{f_{QSS}}{f}\leq0.75$ in the rage of $0.06\leq\massstiff\leq0.1$ and dropped further as \massstiff\ reduces.  

The mere existence of this region questionable as no DNS data could be obtained in this region due to the fact that galloping signal was weak and the techniques used to obtain the  frequency was not sensitive enough to capture these weak signals. There is scope for further study to corroborate or otherwise the QSS prediction using experiments or DNS. 

Yet, The linear expression provided a excellent prediction within the boundaries where DNS data were obtained and therefore complimenting the understanding of the new formulated parameters \massstiff\ and \massdamp and concluding phase 1 of the study.
